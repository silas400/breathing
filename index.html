            <div class="back">
                <p>Research shows breathwork lowers stress, reduces anxiety, and eases depressive symptoms. Slow breathing activates the body’s relaxation system, calming nerves and balancing stress hormones. While not a cure, it’s a simple, accessible practice that supports emotional well-being.</p>

            <div class="back">
                <p>Endorphins are natural mood boosters that help reduce stress and create a sense of calm. By slowing your breathing, you activate the body’s relaxation response, which encourages their release. This simple practice can lift mood, ease tension, and support emotional balance. Over time, mindful breathing becomes a natural way to cultivate resilience against daily stressors.</p>

                <p>A study on Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans tested Sudarshan Kriya yoga, a structured breathing practice. Veterans who practiced it had lower PTSD and anxiety symptoms, calmer breathing rates, and reduced startle responses. These benefits were seen right after the program and lasted up to a year. The results suggest breathing exercises can be a powerful tool to support recovery from trauma.</p>

                <p>People with insomnia often struggle to relax enough for restful sleep. Practicing slow, steady breathing for about 20 minutes at night helped them drift off faster and stay asleep longer. Their sleep also became deeper and more refreshing. This shows breathing exercises can be a simple, natural way to improve sleep.</p>

            <div class="back">
                <p>Practicing slow, controlled breathing for 5–10 minutes daily can significantly support cardiovascular health. Longer exhales trigger the body’s relaxation response, easing blood vessel tension and lowering heart rate. A 2023 review in Frontiers in Physiology found that most breathing practices reduced both systolic and diastolic pressure. While not a replacement for medication, this habit strengthens stress resilience and promotes steadier blood pressure over time.</p>

                <p>Specific techniques can strengthen the lungs and improve airflow, making it easier to breathe during flare-ups.

                <p>Each breath fuels the body with oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, keeping every cell alive. Because breathing happens automatically, most people rarely notice how often it occurs. Yet the sheer number shows how powerful the breath is as a constant influence on health. Small changes in how we breathe can add up to major long-term benefits.</p>

                <p>Breathing through your nose does more than just move air. It filters out germs, warms and moistens each breath, and helps your body take in more oxygen. Mouth breathing skips all of that, which can make you more likely to get sick, feel short of breath, or even have changes to your teeth and jaw over time.</p>

                <p>A sigh—a deep, augmented breath—reopens tiny lung air sacs (alveoli) that collapse during normal breathing. This helps preserve lung function and oxygen exchange, preventing progressive lung collapse. It's an automatic yet essential respiratory “reset” we do every few minutes to keep our lungs functioning efficiently, even without realizing it.</p>

                <p>When you inhale, your heart speeds up slightly, and when you exhale, it slows down.
